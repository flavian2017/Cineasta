Privacy Policy for Cineasta
Effective Date: 31/12/2024

Thank you for using Cineasta! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.

1. Information We Collect
Cineasta does not collect, store, or share any personal information or data. While the app uses an internet connection to fetch movie details from external sources, no identifiable user data is collected or transmitted during this process.

All information you provide, such as movies, ratings, and reviews, is stored locally on your device and is not shared with any server or third party.

2. How We Use Your Information
The movie details fetched via the internet are used to populate your watchlist and provide additional information about movies and TV shows.

All user-provided information, such as ratings and reviews, remains private within the app and is used solely for your personalized experience.

3. Data Storage
All user-generated data, including your watchlist, ratings, and reviews, is stored locally on your device. Cineasta ensures that your information remains private and secure.

The app requires an internet connection only to retrieve movie details, which are then stored locally for offline use.

4. Data Sharing
Cineasta does not share your data with any third parties. All information remains private and under your control.

5. Security
As Cineasta does not collect or transmit user data externally, your information's security depends on your device. We recommend using device-level security, such as passwords or biometric authentication, to safeguard your data.

6. User Control
You have full control over your data. You can modify or delete your movie entries, ratings, and reviews at any time directly through the app.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. If changes occur, the updated Privacy Policy will be made available within the app, and the "Effective Date" will be revised.
